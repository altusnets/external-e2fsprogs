.SH DESCRIPTION
.B e4crypt
performs encryption management for ext4 file systems.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
Prompts the user for a passphrase and transforms it into an ecryption
key for use by ext4.   The encryption key will be added to the specified
keyring, with a type "logon" (which makes the key accessible to the
user, but which does not allow the key to be returned to userspace), and
with the descrpiptor of the key set to "ext4:" followed the encryption
key identifer, which is composed of 16 hexadecimal characters calculated
by taking a cryptographic hash of the key.
.TP
.B \-k
.I keyring
This option specifies the keyring to which the key will be added.  See
the keyctl man page for more details, but the only keyring which only
makes sence is @u, @s, and @us, which specifies the user, session, and
user session keyrings, respectively.   By default,
.B e4crypt
will add the key to the session keyring if it has been establishd for
the current process, or the user session keyring if it has not.
.TP
.B \-n
.I salt
The salt must be specified, and it should be unique for each
passphrase.  The salt consists of up to 256 hexadecimal bytes.
.TP
.B \-s
Sets a policy for the directories specified on the command line.
All directories must be empty to set the policy; if the directory
already has a policy established,
.B e4crypt
will validate that the policy is what was specified.  A policy is an
encryption key identifier of length 16 hexadecimal characters.
